I'm Nelson, a programmer. I have occasionally referred to myself as an
"explorer". Not in the sense of exploring caves or cities or the world, more
in the sense of exploring computers and software.

As a programmer, most of my experience is working with the Web. I am most
familiar with JavaScript, and I take pride in having a solid understanding
of how the Web works - everything from the protocols to the languages that
make it up. I'd probably consider myself an expert, if I had the reputation
to back up such a claim.

While being _most_ familiar with the Web, I'm far from restricted to it. I
frequently hack around with bash, and I'm fully comfortable in Python and
Lua. I also have a working understanding of Java, and can stand on my own in
C, Go and Ruby. Additionally, I have, to some extent, worked with just about
any language you are likely to think of (with the notable exceptions of
Haskell and Erlang). Yes, including that one. And that one.

I'm also particularly fond of doing crazy things with my computer. I'm
experimenting with a wide variety of Linux distributions, including custom
entirely-from-source stuff (with help from LFS).

I'll try to keep posting to this site, but to be honest I'm not very good at
remembering to do regular updates for very long. We'll see how it goes.
